# Chester Parser Architecture and Improvement Plan

## Overview

Chester is migrating from the original `reader` implementation (V1) to a new `readerv2` (V2). This document covers both the migration status and the planned improvements to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance of the parser components.

## Parser Architecture

### Syntax Design Principles

#### 1. Uniform Symbol Treatment
- All identifiers and operators are treated uniformly in parsing
- No special cases for keywords like "if", "then", "else" - they are just identifiers
- Parser doesn't distinguish between keywords and regular identifiers
- Semantic meaning determined in later passes
- Examples:
  ```scala
  // These parse exactly the same way:
  case x => y
  myCase x => y
  
  // Both produce:
  OpSeq([identifier, expr, identifier, expr])
  ```

#### 2. Operator and Identifier Rules
- Operators start with operator symbols (.:=-+\|<>/?`~!@$%^&*)
- Identifiers start with letters/emoji/underscore
- Both can contain operator symbols and word symbols
- Key rules:
  - No special casing of operators - determined by character patterns
  - All operator identification delegated to consistent rules
  - Operators and identifiers form a uniform sequence: `expr op expr op expr ...`
  ```scala
  1 + 2          // OpSeq([1, +, 2])
  if x then y    // OpSeq([if, x, then, y])  // "if" and "then" are just identifiers
  val x = 1      // OpSeq([val, x, =, 1])    // "val" is just an identifier
  ```

#### 3. Separation of Concerns
- Parser only produces flat OpSeq nodes without any knowledge of operator semantics
- Operator precedence, fixity (infix/prefix/postfix), and associativity are handled in later passes
- This separation allows flexible operator definition and extension
- No predefined keywords (if/then/else/val) or operators (+/-/*)

#### 4. Space and Newline Handling
- Spaces are significant in specific contexts:
  - Function calls: `f()` vs `f ()` - space before parentheses changes interpretation
  - Operator sequences: Spaces don't affect operator precedence but improve readability
- Newlines have special significance in specific contexts:
  - After blocks: Newline after a block ends the expression (i.e., `}\n` terminates the expression)
  - Control structures: Newlines are treated differently based on context, not on specific keywords
  - Pattern matching, conditionals, etc.: The behavior is consistent across all control structures 
  - Within blocks: Newlines within blocks are not significant
  - Syntax patterns like `}\n` (closing brace followed by newline) have context-dependent meanings
  - Two key cases where `}\n` has special semantic significance:
    1. Function/method definitions: Newline after closing brace marks end of the definition
       ```
       def factorial(n) {
         if n <= 1 then 1
         else n * factorial(n - 1)
       } // <- newline here ends the function definition
       
       val result = factorial(5); // Next statement
       ```
    2. Match expressions: Newline after closing brace marks end of the match expression
       ```
       val result = notification match {
         case Email(sender, _) => {
           println(sender);
           "Email received"
         } // <- block for this case
         case SMS(number, _) => "SMS received";
       } // <- newline here ends the match expression
       
       println(result); // Next statement
       ```

#### 5. Block Return Value Semantics
- Rust-like block return value semantics
- Last expression in block is the return value
- Examples:
  - `{a}` -> returns value of a
  - `{a;}` -> equivalent to `{a; ()}` -> returns unit
  - `{a; b}` -> returns value of b
  - `{a; b;}` -> equivalent to `{a; b; ()}` -> returns unit

#### 6. Error Handling
- Designed to handle incomplete/broken source code
- Produces meaningful partial results when possible
- Uses ErrorExpr to represent recoverable parse errors

#### 7. Incremental Parsing
- Supports partial parsing of incomplete expressions
- Maintains parser state for potential incremental updates
- Useful for IDE integration

### Parser Implementations

#### Original Parser Design (V1)
- Uses FastParse combinators for a declarative style
- Context object tracks parsing state
- Functional composition of parsers
- Fully functional and used in production

#### ReaderV2 Approach (V2)
- Token-based parsing with state machine
- More imperative style with mutable state
- Pattern matching on tokens for different constructs
- Explicit recursion with depth tracking

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Comment Preservation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The V2 parser previously didn't properly preserve comments and attach them to expressions via ExprMeta.commentInfo
- **Improvement**: Implemented comment collection and attachment similar to the V1 parser (Parser.scala)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Preserves important documentation in the code
  - Enables proper code formatting with comments
  - Maintains semantic information that may be in comments
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Added comment collection methods (`collectComments`, `collectTrailingComments`)
  2. Created appropriate CommentInfo structures for leading and trailing comments
  3. Attached comments to expressions using ExprMeta with `createMetaWithComments`
  4. Implemented comment-aware parsing methods (`parseAtomWithComments`, `parseBlockWithComments`, `parseListWithComments`)
  5. Fixed whitespace token handling for proper newline detection
  6. All 100 tests now pass, confirming compatibility with V1 parser behavior

### 2. Number Parsing Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The number parsing logic in `parseNumber()` was complex and had nested conditionals
- **Improvement**: Extracted specialized methods for different number formats:
  - `parseDecimalNumber()`
  - `parseHexNumber()`
  - `parseBinaryNumber()`
  - `parseExponent()`
- **Benefits**: Improved readability, easier maintenance, better error handling
- **Implementation**: Extracted four methods from the original complex code, improving error messages and making the logic more modular.

### 3. Enhanced Escape Character Handling ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The `escapeCharToString()` method only handled basic escape sequences
- **Improvement**: Extended to support more escape sequences including:
  - Unicode escapes (`\u1234`)
  - Octal escapes (`\123`)
  - Hex escapes (`\x12`)
- **Benefits**: More comprehensive string support, better consistency
- **Implementation**: Created a new `parseEscapeSequence()` method with comprehensive escape handling, better error reporting, and proper position tracking.

### 4. Operator Parsing Clean-Up ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Special-case handling for `=>` and comments within `parseOperator()`
- **Improvement**: Extracted comment parsing to a separate method
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code structure, better separation of concerns
- **Implementation**: Extracted `parseComment()` method and improved `parseOperator()` with clearer structure and better comments.

### 5. Identifier Parsing Correctness ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Inconsistent character detection in `parseIdentifier()`
- **Improvement**: 
  - Aligned with `IdentifierRules.isIdentifierPart()` for character validation
  - Ensured proper handling of supplementary code points (Unicode/emoji)
  - Maintained consistency between entry points and internal validation
- **Benefits**: 
  - Correct parsing of all valid identifiers according to language specification
  - Consistent handling of Unicode characters and emoji
  - Better maintainability through unified validation rules
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added import for `isIdentifierPart` from `IdentifierRules`
  - Created helper method for proper character validation
  - Updated character checking logic to handle both ASCII and Unicode properly
  - Ensured supplementary code points were handled consistently

### 6. SourcePos Creation Efficiency ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The `createSourcePos()` method recalculated UTF-16 offsets on every call
- **Improvement**: 
  - Implemented a caching mechanism for UTF-16 offset calculations
  - Calculated offsets incrementally rather than from scratch each time
  - Added a position cache to store already computed offsets
  - Updated the cache as positions change during tokenization
- **Benefits**: 
  - Significant performance improvement, especially for large files
  - Reduced tokenization time for complex expressions
  - More responsive parsing for interactive environments
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added a position cache using HashMap to store UTF-16 offsets
  - Modified `createSourcePos()` to check the cache before calculating
  - Updated methods that modify position to use and update the cache
  - Added incremental calculation for new positions based on cached values

## Current Priorities

### 1. V1/V2 Semantic Consistency ⚠️ PRIORITY
- **Issue**: 
  - Some tests still use `parseAndCheck` (V1-only) instead of `parseAndCheckBoth`
  - This indicates potential semantic differences between V1 and V2 parsers
  - The goal is to ensure both parsers produce the same AST for the same input
- **Areas to Address**:
  - Complex operator sequences (prefix, mixfix operators)
  - Pattern matching with mixed expressions
  - Telescope parsing
  - Error handling consistency
  - Source position tracking
- **Known Limitations**:
  - **Pattern Matching Closing Block**: V2 parser currently struggles with properly handling the closing brace of pattern matching blocks. This is evident in `SimplePatternMatchingTest` which uses `parseAndCheck` instead of `parseAndCheckBoth`.
  - **Complex Pattern Nesting**: More complex nested pattern matching constructs are not yet fully supported in V2 parser, as they require more sophisticated parsing of block termination.
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Analyze test files still using `parseAndCheck` to identify semantic differences
  2. Prioritize addressing the complex operator sequence handling first
  3. Implement proper handling for prefix and mixfix operators in V2
  4. Test and verify with existing test cases
  5. Update tests to use `parseAndCheckBoth` once they pass
  6. Document any intentional semantic differences that won't be addressed
- **Benefits**:
  - More consistent parsing behavior between V1 and V2
  - Higher confidence in V2 parser for all use cases
  - Easier migration path from V1 to V2
  - More tests running against both parsers

### 2. Object Expressions ⚠️ PRIORITY
- **Issue**: Object expressions support in V2 is incomplete, especially for complex objects
- **Improvement**: 
  - Complete object expressions implementation with string literal and symbol keys
  - Ensure complex object syntax works properly
  - Handle advanced object features
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Review current object parsing implementation
  2. Identify missing features compared to V1
  3. Implement support for complex object syntax
  4. Test with a variety of object expressions

### 3. Telescope Parsing ⚠️ PRIORITY
- **Issue**: Telescope parsing is not yet implemented in V2
- **Improvement**: Implement telescope parsing in V2 to match V1 semantics
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Analyze V1 telescope parsing implementation
  2. Design and implement equivalent functionality in V2
  3. Test with existing telescope tests

### 4. Block Termination and Newline Handling in V2 Parser ⚠️ PRIORITY

#### Problem Analysis:
When examining why the pattern matching test fails with V2 parser, I identified that the V1 and V2 parsers handle the `}\n` pattern (closing brace followed by newline) differently:

1. **V1 Implementation (Parser.scala):**
   - Uses a context parameter `newLineAfterBlockMeansEnds` in `ParsingContext` to determine when a newline after a block should terminate an expression
   - Explicitly checks if the previous token was a closing brace: `val itWasBlockEnding = p.input(index - 1) == '}'`
   - Changes parsing behavior based on this detection
   - This creates different AST structures depending on whether a block is standalone or part of a larger expression

2. **V2 Implementation (LexerV2.scala):**
   - No equivalent tracking for newlines after blocks
   - Token stream treats all whitespace (including newlines) equally
   - No special handling for the case where a closing brace is followed by a newline
   - Doesn't terminate OpSeq expressions when encountering `}\n`

#### Implementation Challenges:

1. **Tokenization vs. Parsing:**
   - In V1, newline detection happens during parsing
   - In V2, we need to distinguish newlines at the tokenization stage
   - This requires adding a new token type `Token.Newline` distinct from `Token.Whitespace`

2. **Context-Sensitive Parsing:**
   - The meaning of a newline depends on context (after a block vs. elsewhere)
   - V2 parser needs to check for `Token.Newline` after a block and terminate expressions appropriately
   - This affects the `parseRest` method in `LexerV2.scala`

3. **Test Compatibility:**
   - Many tests use `parseAndCheckBoth` which runs both V1 and V2 parsers
   - Tests with newlines after blocks fail because V2 doesn't terminate expressions correctly
   - Pattern matching tests are particularly affected by this issue

4. **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in Error Reporting:**
   - When using `parseAndCheckBoth`, error reporting code in `parseAndCheck.scala` can throw `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`
   - This happens when trying to extract line information for error messages
   - Requires bounds checking to prevent exceptions

#### Implementation Plan:

1. **Token Differentiation:**
   - Add `Token.Newline` class in `Token.scala` to distinguish newlines from other whitespace
   - Modify `Tokenizer.skipWhitespace()` to generate `Token.Newline` tokens

2. **Expression Termination:**
   - Update `LexerV2.parseRest()` to check for `Token.Newline` after blocks
   - Add condition: `case Right(Token.Newline(_)) if isBlockExpression(expr) => ...`
   - Terminate expression parsing when this pattern is detected

3. **Error Handling Improvements:**
   - Add bounds checking in `parseAndCheck.scala` to prevent `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`
   - Ensure safe substring extraction for error messages

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Fix the core newline handling in V2 parser
   - Ensure pattern matching tests pass with both parsers
   - Gradually migrate more tests to use `parseAndCheckBoth`

#### Progress:
- ✅ Added `Token.Newline` class in `Token.scala`
- ✅ Modified tokenizer to generate `Token.Newline` tokens
- ✅ Updated `LexerV2.parseRest()` to check for newlines after blocks
- ✅ Fixed bounds checking in error reporting
- ✅ Verified pattern matching tests pass with V1 parser
- ⏳ Ensuring all tests pass with both parsers

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with smaller, isolated improvements that don't affect the overall architecture ✅
2. Add comprehensive tests before making significant changes ✅
3. Update one component fully before moving to the next ✅
4. Prioritize improvements that enhance maintainability first ✅
5. Verify each change with existing tests before proceeding to the next improvement ✅
6. Complete high-priority features like comment preservation ✅
7. Update documentation to reflect implementation progress ✅

## Next Steps

1. Address V1/V2 Semantic Consistency to ensure V2 parser correctly implements V1 semantics
   - Focus on complex operator sequences (prefix, mixfix) first
   - Address pattern matching semantic differences
   - Implement proper telescope parsing
2. Complete object expressions implementation
3. Add source maps support
4. Continue migration of V1-only tests to V2
5. Implement error recovery mechanisms
